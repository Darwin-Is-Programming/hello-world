### `Favorite Music Artist & Track:`  
  While I don't have any specific favorite musical artist as most of my playlists are composed of music from my favorite video games, one group/company that's always at the top of my list is **Atlus** and the **Atlus Sound Team**. One of my recent favorites of theirs is ***It's Going Down Now*** from the semi-recent release of *Persona 3 Reload*.
